What does it do?
================

Vite AssetCollector allows you to use the modern frontend bundler `vite <https://vitejs.dev/>`__
to build your TYPO3 project's frontend assets.

Vite supports all common CSS processors and TypeScript out-of-the-box and has a wide range
of well-supported plugins for popular frontend frameworks. Its hot module replacement feature
allows you to develop your frontend assets without constantly reloading the browser to see your
changes. As a bonus, vite offers a simple configuration and is easy to use.

It is recommended to use this extension together with a corresponding vite plugin, however
it's also possible to configure vite manually.
